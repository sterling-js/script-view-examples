# River Crossing

The classic river crossing puzzle.

## `river.js`

Renders a river and boxes that represent river crossers. Project over `State` 
and step through atoms to move the boxes across the river.

Requires:
* Stage: `<svg>`
* Libraries:
  * D3

## `river-img.js`

Renders a river and SVG images that represent the river crossers. SVG image
URLs are shamelessly ripped from Google Image searches and are unlikely to
work for very long. If an image is not showing up, just replace the URL
with something valid.

Project over `State` and step through atoms to move the boxes across the river.

Requires:
* Stage: `<svg>`
* Libraries:
  * D3
