# Sterling Script View Examples

This repository contains Alloy/Forge models and their associated visualization
scripts. Each directory contains a README, a single model, and the script(s) used to
generate instance visualizations for that model. The README gives a brief description
of the model and includes the required stage type and libraries Sterling will need 
to generate the visualization.
